Programming Language:
- Python
Tools:
- Used Gemini to help me. (Not to do everything).


Instructions:
- Run the code.

NOTE:
I have 2 codes. One gives the correct output of the 
first 2 automatas (The one attached).
The other one of the last 2 (Sadly).

I just thought it was worth mentioning, if 2 codes
were to be accepted.
